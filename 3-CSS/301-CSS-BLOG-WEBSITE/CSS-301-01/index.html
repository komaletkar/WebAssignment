                Typography is one of the most important aspects of your design system to establish early onâ€”think of how much information you'll communicate to users through type. Type could account for 85-90% of any given screen. Typography is often one of the foundational components you will want to get a handle on as it will need to work harmoniously with other elements like icons and UI controls. Your line-heights may even influence many other structural elements like spacing and grids. 
                Here are a few key areas you'll want to think through depending on whether your system needs to support product or a marketing website (where brand personality may be a higher priority). There are many things to factor into your decision, but its a good 
                idea to find the right balance between personality, performance, and on-screen legibility.

                There are many considerations when choosing typefaces, especially for use on-screen. You may also need to work cross-functionally with brand/marketing teams to accommodate your brand's typefaces and determine how they'll fit into your system. Typefaces can be another touchpoint to help subtly convey the right tone and personality throughout your digital experiences. If your brand has a very unique typeface, not ideal for extended reading or small sizes, you may opt to reserve it for display sizes for elements like headlines that are used less frequently. In this case, you may want to pair it with a more legible typeface for the bulk of the typography that will appear at smaller sizes. If performance is a critical goal, many design systems will often leverage system/native font-stacks for different platforms to avoid loading web-fonts (as seen in the Shopify Polaris system). Of course, you may also decide to handle these things depending on whether your system needs to support product or a marketing website (where brand personality may be a higher priority). There are many things to factor into your decision, but its a good 
                idea to find the right balance between personality, performance, and on-screen legibility.

                As you start to work on these font and line-height parings, also think about how many sizes you need, and which sizes will map to particular weights or styles.
                Make sure you accommodate all of the applications you'll need, factoring in everything from helper-text and form labels, to body copy and subheads, to headlines.
